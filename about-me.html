<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<br>
<br>
    <p>I'm a part-time beginner developer. I usually write some code if I had the time, because I'm very busy with school and I have a lot of homework to do.</p><br>
    <p>But why did I start coding?</p><br>
    <p>It's because that some time ago, I'm inspired by my father and other people who can write code.
        At that moment I began writing some code in Java because I have Minecraft mods. I began making a game
        called "<code>The Legend of Dragonite</code>". This is my first ever created game. I don't know if I will continue but maybe I will.
    </p><br>
    <p>Not long after, I began to write some Python, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and C++ because I'm bored and don't know what to do.
        I created the first website, and that is this, <code>KAHEZRA</code>.is-a.dev.
